# FFT-hacking-
Combining all the sound files of the computer

to create audio data theft through the form of sound. The distortion and damage to audio files... it's just like the image of a computer being hacked.

The simplest method used is the average method, which merges each sample point. My computer has extracted a total of 565 files (although not all files can be used), and the unexpected results are quite good.

The average algorithm takes the average of each audio with the current audio. The formula is: s = (n + s) / 2, where's represents the overall audio and n represents the individual audio. Therefore, the last audio file has the highest weight, which is 1/2. The overall weight follows an exponential change.


希望透過聲音的形式來創造出聲音化的資料竊取，音訊檔案的失真、損毀⋯⋯，正好也形同電腦被駭入的形象。
其中使用最簡單的平均法將每個取樣點做合併，我電腦共爬出565個檔案（但不是所有檔案皆可使用），意外的效果不錯～
平均演算法為每一個與當前音訊的平均，s = (n+s)/2，s為整體音訊，n為單一音訊，因此最後一個音訊檔案權重最大，為1/2，整體權重成指數級變化
